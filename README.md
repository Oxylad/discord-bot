Discord Transport Tycoon Bot Made By Oxylad
 
 This project is a small project i started to make my python level go up and develop my skills for fun little projects.
 
 If you want to download this bot and run it at home you will need to create a key.py file in the folder where the bot.py file is located.
 
 The structure of the key.py file will need to be along the lines of :
 
 key = "(key from /api private copy inside the transport tycoon chatbox)"
 BOT_TOKEN = "(discord bot token from developer portal)"
 CHANNEL_ID = (id of the channel the bot will respond in)
 
 (if you somehow want to use part of my code feel free to use it but credit me @Oxylad#0994 on discord)
